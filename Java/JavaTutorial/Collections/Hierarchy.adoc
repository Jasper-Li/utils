== Collection
. Collection is a container.
* add or remove elements;
* test for the presence of a given element;
* ask for the number of elements contained, or if this collection is empty;
* clear this content.

. Collection is a set of element.
* testing for the inclusion of a set in another set;
* union;
* intersection;
* complement.

. Collection's accessing ways
* iterate over all the elements
* create a stream on these elements, that can be parallel.

== List
. List elements are ordered as they're added.
. Every element has an index.
* Get an element at a specific index, or delete it
* Insert an element or replace an element at a specific position
* Get a range of elements between two indexes.

== Set
. No duplicates

=== Set extensions: SortedSet
All elements sorted in the ascending order.

. What you can to?
* Get the lowest element, and the largest element of the set
* Extract a *headSet* and a *tailSet* of all the elements lesser than, or greater than a given element.

=== Set extensions: NavigableSet.
The same as NavigableSet, except iterating over the elements in the descending order.
